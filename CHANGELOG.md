## INDEV-1.4.0

This update does a lot of big things, including making *help less awful, an *8ball command, a command for blurry cats, and completely reworking the moderation command system (you used to need an admin role, now it just checks your perms).

-Reworked moderation commands to be based of user permissions
-Reworked *help to be less confusing
